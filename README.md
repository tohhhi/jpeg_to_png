--- Jpeg to Png ---

Libraries: PIL (Pillow), os (Miscellaneous operating system interfaces), sys (System-specific parameters and functions)

Description: In this Project I make a useful tool that can transform a large number of jpeg images to png very fast. 
    
How it works? 

From terminal we need to type python jpeg_to_png.py (name of folder with jpeg images) (name of new folder) ; Example: python jpeg_to_png.py Pokedex\ new\
    
How I build this tool?

First I search for a good library and up to date also with good documentation. To make this tool more easy to use for people we took the parameters 
from terminal first parameter is the folder with jpeg images and second parameter is a folder that is created when the script is executed, we dont need 
to create one ourself and this is nice also the name can be custom. Then the library help us and make the process of conversion very fast to png. 
After we change each element we save them to a new file.
